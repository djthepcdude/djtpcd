    <p>All estimates are good-faith quotes based on current diagnosis. Final price can change if additional issues are discovered.</p>
    <p>Data safety is prioritized, but clients are responsible for backups before service when possible.</p>
    <p>Hardware and software outcomes depend on third-party vendors and existing device conditions; no guarantee of compatibility with unsupported systems.</p>
    <p>Emergency-tier jobs may include rush pricing agreed before work begins.</p>
